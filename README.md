# Warsow

Warsow is set in a futuristic cartoonish world where rocketlauncher-wielding
pigs and lasergun-carrying cyberpunks roam the streets. It is a completely free,
fast-paced first-person shooter for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

Speed and movement is what Warsow is all about. Like a true cyberathlete you
jump, dash, dodge, and walljump your way through the game. Grab power-ups before
your enemy does, plant a bomb before anyone sees you, and steal the enemy's flag
before they know what is going on!

Our goal is to offer a fast and fun competitive first-person shooter without
hard graphical violence - Warsow has no blood or guts flying around. Red stars
instead of blood indicate hits and colored cubes replace guts as gib effects.
