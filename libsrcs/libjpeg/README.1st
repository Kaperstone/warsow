This package is identical to the IJG JPEG 6b release except that it
uses a modern build system based on the latest autoconf, automake, and
libtool.  In fact, CVS versions of autoconf and libtool were used to
create this package.  Later versions of the package are likely to use
released versions of autoconf and libtool.

The package is produced by Bob Friesenhahn <bfriesen@GraphicsMagick.org>
so that is where any bug reports pertaining to building this package
should be sent to.
